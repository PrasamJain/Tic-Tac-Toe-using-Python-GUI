# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Python-GUI
we create a tic-toe toe game using python GUI interference called Tkinter framework.

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players,
X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
Tkinter Python library is used to create the GUI. 
Two options are available to play the game, along with the system or with another player.


# About python GUI framework - Tkinter

Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard library. 
Tkinter has several strengths. It’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

However, Tkinter is lightweight and relatively painless to use compared to other frameworks. 
This makes it a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, especially for applications where a modern sheen 
is unnecessary, and the top priority is to quickly build something that’s functional and cross-platform.

#In this repo, you’ll learn how to:

                                  Get started with Tkinter with its application.
                                  Work with widgets, such as buttons and text boxes.
                                  Control your application layout with geometry managers.
                                  Make your applications interactive by associating button clicks with Python functions.
                                  And last, we Building our Python GUI Application With Tkinter.
