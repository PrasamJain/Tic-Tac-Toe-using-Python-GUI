we create a tic-toe toe game using python GUI interference called Tkinter framework.

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players,
X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
